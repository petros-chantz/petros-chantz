## Hey there, Petros here!

- ##### I'm a UX Researcher and an all around creative technologist. 
- ##### I'm passionate about **making**, **prototyping** and **fabricating** within all mediums.  
- ##### I'm always eager to learn with and from others. 

##### Currently busy learning **React.js** (soonish **Gatsby.js** - *maybe ?*) and other front-end libraries/frameworks.

*oh! And if you have any new good responsive CSS tips don't be shy! Drop them into my inbox!*
